.SH NAME
simple_shell \- a minimal UNIX command interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ./hsh
[\fIFILE\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B simple_shell
is a minimal implementation of a UNIX command line interpreter. It reads commands from either standard input or from a file and executes them in a child process.
.PP
The shell supports basic command execution, environment variable handling, and simple built-in commands.
.SH COMMAND EXECUTION
When invoked interactively, the shell displays a prompt
.RB ( "$ " )
and waits for user input. Commands are executed by forking a child process which executes the requested program.
.PP
The shell searches for executables in the directories listed in the
.B PATH
environment variable.
.SH BUILT-IN COMMANDS
The shell implements the following built-in commands:
.TP
.B exit
[\fIstatus\fR]
Exit the shell with the specified status (default: 0).
.TP
.B env
Print the current environment variables.
.TP
.B setenv
[\fIvariable\fR] [\fIvalue\fR]

.TP
.B unsetenv
[\fIvariable\fR]
Remove an environment variable.

.B cd
[\fIdirectory\fR]
Change the current working directory. With no arguments, changes to the home directory.
